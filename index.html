            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                We develop tools that help groups think better together. Our work explores how AI can enhance collective
                reasoning while keeping humans meaningfully in the loop.
            </p>
            <p>
                As we approach transformative AI capabilities, the quality of our collective decision-making becomes
                increasingly critical. We believe that by thoughtfully integrating AI into collaborative interfaces, we
                can augment human deliberation rather than replace it. Our tools help groups explore disagreements, find
                unexpected consensus, and make better decisions together.
            </p>
            <p>
                Current projects include experimental interfaces for structured group deliberation, disagreement
                mapping, and collaborative sense-making. Through these practical explorations, we're working to ensure
                that human agency and collective wisdom remain central as AI capabilities advance.
            </p>
            <p>
                We're actively researching and prototyping new ways for AI to support group reasoning - from helping
                surface common ground in contentious discussions to identifying productive directions for further
                exploration. Our goal is to develop interfaces that grow more capable alongside AI while remaining
                deeply human-centered.

                        When atomic energy was developed, people gained the power both to produce green energy and to
                        destroy entire cities. They did not gain the wisdom to use that power responsibly, nor the
                        ability
                        to ensure their power was used cooperatively for the good of all.

                        To safely navigate the risk of advanced AI, we need technology which enables coordination,
                        empowers
                        human groups to think clearly, and prevents disastrous conflicts. The order in which technology
                        is
                        developed matters. We aim to accelerate work which uses recent advances in AI capabilities to
                        enable
                        better collective reasoning and coordination, and gives people the ability to navigate an
                        uncertain
                        future.

                        Our mission is to improve human reasoning at the group level, focusing on the ways in which
                        people
                        communicate information and resolve disagreements. In particular, we are prototyping the use of
                        AI
                        to mediate group deliberation. This means both using AI to intervene on the dynamics of a
                        discussion, as well as being an interface for people to better understand the content of what is
                        being discussed. We are pioneering new architectures for group dialogue and reasoning, finding
                        ways
                        to integrate the unique abilities of AI systems while keeping humans and human reasoning at the
                        center.

                        We are building experimental interfaces which test new strategies for AI mediate collective

                        Software can often serve as a nucleation site for dialogue, and become a part of the ontology we
                        use
                        to think about the future (e.g. federated social networks, Polis/Community Notes, or Loom). Our
                        philosophy is to advance the discussion about AI development by building software which embodies
                        our
                        vision for the future.

                        AI systems are improving rapidly. For this reason, itâ€™s important that work to augment human
                        reasoning improves alongside AI capability advancements, and is not made obsolete by them.
                        Furthermore, better human reasoning and decision making is critical to navigating the transition
                        to
                        superhuman AI safely, and making the right choices about how to engineer the future we want.
