                Mosaic is an experimental research lab focused on <b>reducing the risks from advanced AI</b> by
                improving the quality of human reasoning. We build interfaces for AI-mediated collective reasoning
                and deliberation, and conduct research into how AI assistance can help humans collaboratively
                solve problems.

                Rapid developments in AI are quickly transforming the future of reasoning, communication, and conflict.
                Our goal is to <b>ambitiously apply AI to collective deliberation problems</b>, explore the frontier of
                human-machine collaboration, and to keep human reasoning at the center of institutional
                decision-making.

                        When atomic energy was developed, people gained the power both to produce green energy and to
                        kill millions. They did not gain the wisdom to use that power responsibly, nor the ability
                        to ensure their power was used cooperatively for the good of all.

                        To safely navigate the risk of advanced AI, we need technology which enables coordination,
                        empowers human groups to think clearly, and prevents disastrous conflicts. <b>The order in which
                            technology is developed matters</b>. We aim to accelerate work which uses recent advances in
                        AI
                        capabilities to enable better collective reasoning and coordination, and gives people the

                        Our mission is to improve human reasoning at the group level, focusing on the ways in which
                        people communicate information and resolve disagreements. In particular, we are prototyping the
                        use of
                        <b>AI to mediate group deliberation</b>. This means both using AI to intervene on the dynamics
                        of
                        a discussion, as well as being an interface for people to better understand the content of what
                        is
                        being discussed. We are pioneering new architectures for group dialogue and reasoning, finding
                        ways to integrate the unique abilities of AI systems while keeping humans and human reasoning at
                        the
                        center.

                        We are building experimental interfaces which test new strategies for AI-mediated collective

                        Software can often serve as a <b>nucleation site for dialogue</b>, and become a part of the
                        ontology we
                        use to think about the future (e.g. <a href="https://mastodon.social">federated social

                        AI systems are improving rapidly. For this reason, it's important that work to augment human
                        reasoning <b>improves alongside AI capability advancements</b>, and is not replaced or made
                        obsolete by
                        them. Better human reasoning and decision making is critical to navigating the transition
                        to superhuman AI safely, and making the right choices about how to engineer the future we want.

                        We are especially concerned that <b>important reasoning may be totally outsourced to AI

                        this reason we are dedicated to keeping humans at the center of our interfaces, and focus our
                        research on how AI mediation can support entirely human-lead reasoning and discussion.
